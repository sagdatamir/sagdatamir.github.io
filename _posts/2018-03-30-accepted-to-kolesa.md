# Accepted

I was finally accepted to the company [**KolesaKrishaMarket**](https://kolesa.kz) as a junior iOS developer. 

The internship was 2 months long with pre-learning period of 2 weeks.

I learned a lot through this period. Basically from 0 to something close to 0.05. I mean in terms of iOS development. That is a huge difference.

I knew many things, from algorithms and data structures to software architecture, but only theoretical things, no practice. It turned out that I could apply most of my knowledge in this place and I did my best to do that. 

## what I learned

- software architecture

  I only knew the idea behind MVC and could possibly apply it on a web or iOS project.

  now I know about 4 different achitectural designs common to iOS development and can apply the hardest of them: VIPER.

- Objective-C

  from being zero in the language, I am becoming more proficient. I go deep into things, such as multithreading and  memory management, this is interesting stuff.

  I remember that on a test I could even create a class.

- UIKit, interface builder

  hardly could I set proper constraints in the IB. with help of our mentors I have much less problems with this. still much to learn.

- teamwork

  I sincerely tried to make our team more productive, helping each time. I am more proficient in **git** here, so people ask for help. I am always glad to!

- many more

  this list can go longer, but these are the main things I can remember.

## thoughts and feelings

This place is the best place to be.

I am very happy to become a part of such team. The iOS team is fucking amazing. They are the greatest.

I want to make a big impact on the company and make it better place than it is now.

By the way, this is my first place of work
